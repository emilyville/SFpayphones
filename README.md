connecting you with a lot of pay phones 

lives at sfpayphones.urbansmore.com

This app calls an outdated (~2007) dataset of payphones in San Francisco by neighborhood, and connects the call to the first one that answers. The goal was to create a verified and correct map and dataset of payphones in San Francisco.

It uses...
--------------------
-A public google spreadsheet for the pay phone locations and numbers:
https://docs.google.com/a/emilyville.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0AhXimdB90zwNdFk1dmlzbjNSclVkUmliQU4wU2hyOHc&output=html

-D3 to vizualize which ones are ringing

How to using the app  
--------------------
Text the name of the neighborhood to 415-508-6687 to be connected with all the payphones in that neighborhood. It sometimes crashes - that's a lot of phone calls. If so, just ping me.
